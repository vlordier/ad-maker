#### **1.1. User Input Collection and Processing**:
The agent collects the following essential input data from the user:
- **Ad Theme**: A concise description provided by the user, such as "Winter clothing sale" or "Summer sports gear promo."
- **Platform**: The target platform for the ad storyboard, which could be TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook. Each platform has unique formats, audience preferences, and stylistic guidelines that must be adhered to.
- **Ad Duration**: The total length of the ad in seconds, which can range from 0 to 60 seconds. The duration directly influences the number of scenes generated.

---

#### **1.2. Ad Concept Generation and Refinement**:
- **Agent Name**: `GenerateAdConceptAgent`
  - **Task**: Generate a high-level **ad concept** based on the user-provided theme and platform.
  - **Approach**: Employs **Few-Shot Learning** to prime GPT-4 with examples of successful ad concepts, ensuring consistent structure and tone throughout the ad.
  - **Prompt Design**:
    - The prompt includes theme and platform details, along with examples of ad concepts for similar themes. For instance, it may guide GPT-4 to focus on visually appealing, short-form content for TikTok, while emphasizing storytelling for Instagram.
    - Extensive Few-Shot Prompt Examples:
      ```markdown
      Generate a storyboard for a 15-second TikTok ad promoting winter clothing. Here are some examples:

      Example 1: "Winter Comfort": A young woman wraps herself in a cozy sweater while walking through snow-covered streets. The ad emphasizes warmth and style.

      Example 2: "Summer Vibes": A group of friends enjoy a sunny day at the beach, showcasing vibrant swimwear. The ad highlights fun and relaxation.

      Example 3: "Tech Trends": A young professional uses the latest smartphone features in a bustling city. The ad focuses on innovation and connectivity.

      Example 4: "Eco Adventure": A family explores a lush forest, highlighting eco-friendly outdoor gear. The ad promotes sustainability and adventure.

      Example 5: "Fitness Goals": An athlete trains in a gym, showcasing new sports equipment. The ad emphasizes strength and determination.

      Now, create a similar concept based on the theme "Winter clothing sale."
      ```

  - **ReACT Prompt Design and Error Handling**:
    - The ReACT prompts are designed to handle validation errors and retry logic:
      ```markdown
      If the scene headline is too long, suggest a shorter alternative that maintains the key message. For example, if the headline is "Experience the Ultimate Winter Comfort with Our New Collection," suggest "Ultimate Winter Comfort."

      If the description lacks detail, add specific elements such as colors, emotions, or actions. For example, "A woman walks through snow" could be expanded to "A woman in a red coat walks through a snowy park, smiling as snowflakes fall."

      If the visual element is missing, suggest a relevant visual that enhances the scene. For example, "Add a close-up of the product logo on the coat."
      ```

  - **Example of Integration**:
    - The storyboard generation process should seamlessly integrate these prompts to ensure high-quality outputs. For instance, after generating an initial concept, the system should validate it against platform guidelines and use ReACT prompts to refine any issues.
    - **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate user feedback to iteratively improve the storyboard. If a user suggests changes, the system should adapt and regenerate the storyboard accordingly.

#### **Conditions, Error Handling, and Feedback Loops**:
- **Validation Errors**: If a scene fails validation, detailed error messages are generated to guide corrections. These messages specify the exact issue and suggest possible solutions, allowing users to make precise adjustments.
- **Retry Logic**: The system uses ReACT to intelligently adjust and retry failed scenes, ensuring efficient error correction. This includes automatic adjustments based on error feedback and user input.
- **Feedback Loops**: Implemented to refine outputs based on user input and platform performance. Users can provide feedback on generated content, which is then used to iteratively improve the storyboard. This loop ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and platform requirements.
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate user feedback to iteratively improve the storyboard. If a user suggests changes, the system should adapt and regenerate the storyboard accordingly.
- **Validation Errors**: If a scene fails validation, detailed error messages are generated to guide corrections.
- **Retry Logic**: The system uses ReACT to intelligently adjust and retry failed scenes, ensuring efficient error correction.

#### **1.3. Storyboard Scene Generation and Detailing**:
- **Agent Name**: `StoryboardGenerationAgent`
  - **Task**: Break down the ad concept into multiple scenes, each of which consists of:
    1. **Headline**: A short, punchy title that introduces the scene.
    2. **Description**: A detailed breakdown of the visual and narrative elements of the scene.
    3. **Visual Element**: An optional field describing any specific visuals required (e.g., product close-ups, logo placements).
  - **Scene Count**: The number of scenes is determined by the **ad duration**:
    - For ads under 10 seconds, the agent generates 3 scenes.
    - For 30-second ads, it generates 5 scenes.
    - For 60-second ads, it generates 7 scenes.
  - **Output Format**:
    ```json
    {
      "scene": {
        "headline": "Winter Escape",
        "description": "A woman steps out into the snow wearing the new winter collection coat. The camera zooms in on the intricate details of the coat's design.",
        "visual_element": "Close-up of coat details"
      }
    }
    ```

---

#### **1.4. Validation Process and Criteria**:
- **Agent Name**: `ValidateStoryboardAgent`
  - **Task**: Validate each generated scene against predefined rules using **Pydantic models**. This includes ensuring that all necessary fields (headline, description, and visual element) are correctly populated and adhere to the platform's length and style requirements.
  - **Validation Criteria**:
    - **Headline**: Must be between 3 and 50 characters, should be in title case, and non-empty.
    - **Description**: Must be detailed, contain at least 10 words, and fully describe the scene.
    - **Visual Element**: Optional, but if provided, should describe a specific visual component (e.g., product close-ups, brand logo).
  - **Error Handling**: If validation fails, verbose error messages are returned to GPT-4 for correction.

---

#### **1.5. Retry Mechanism and Optimization**:
- **Agent Name**: `RetryAgent`
  - **Task**: Automatically retry generating only the invalid scenes based on the verbose error messages returned by the validation agent.
  - **Error Messages**: These messages are structured to be fed back into GPT-4 for corrections.
    - Example:
      ```json
      {
        "loc": ["scenes", 2, "headline"],
        "msg": "The headline cannot be empty. It should summarize the scene's key focus."
      }
      ```
  - **ReACT Integration**: The agent uses **ReACT** to reason through the failed validation and generate a correction, rather than simply retrying without adjustment.
