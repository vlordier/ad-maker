# Project Overview

## Introduction

This project focuses on automating the creation and adaptation of digital advertisements using advanced AI technologies. It encompasses several key processes, including ad storyboard design, video cutdown generation, and asset template fitting.

## Key Components

1. **Ad Storyboard Design Agent**: Automates the creation of ad storyboards for platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Utilizes AI to generate, validate, and refine ad concepts.

2. **Video Cutdown Generation**: Produces shorter versions of longer ad videos while preserving key messages and visuals. Involves scene selection, duration management, and transition smoothing.

3. **Asset & Template Fitting Process**: Adapts creative assets into predefined templates, ensuring compliance with platform-specific guidelines and maintaining brand consistency.
