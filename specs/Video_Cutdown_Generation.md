### 2. **C: Video Cutdown Generation (Main Question)**

#### **Objective**:
The **Video Cutdown Generation Agent** is responsible for creating shorter versions (cutdowns) of longer ad videos. It takes a master video (e.g., 60 seconds long) and cuts it down to multiple versions (e.g., 15 seconds, 30 seconds) while preserving key messages and visuals.

---

#### **2.1. Input Data**:
The agent receives the following:
- **Master Video**: The original video file or metadata (such as URL or file path).
- **Target Durations**: A list of target durations for the cutdown versions (e.g., 15 seconds, 30 seconds).
- **Key Scenes**: A list of the most important scenes that should be retained in each cutdown.

---

#### **2.2. Key Scene Detection**:
- **Agent Name**: `KeySceneDetectionAgent`
  - **Task**: Identify the most important scenes in the master video by using visual and audio cues, such as:
    1. **Brand Logo Appearances**
    2. **Key Product Shots**
    3. **Critical Dialogue or Voiceovers**
  - **Scene Weighting**: Assigns a relevance score to each scene, determining its importance for the cutdown.

---

#### **2.3. Cutdown Generation**:
- **Agent Name**: `CutdownGeneratorAgent`
  - **Task**: Based on the selected key scenes and target durations, this agent generates cutdown versions of the master video.
  - **Constraints**:
    - The agent ensures that important scenes (identified by the `KeySceneDetectionAgent`) are retained.
    - The cutdown version should fit within the target duration.
  - **Transition Smoothing**: Adds smooth transitions between the remaining scenes to ensure that the video does not appear disjointed after being cut down.
  - **Output Format**: Produces a final cutdown video in MP4 format, with metadata outlining the included scenes.

### 3. **C: Video Cutdown Generation (Follow-up/Advanced/Further Discussion Questions)**

#### **Objective**:
This section focuses on refining the cutdown process by addressing advanced techniques, such as scene summarization, multi-version optimization, and adaptive feedback mechanisms.

---

#### **3.1. Scene Summarization**:
- **Agent Name**: `SceneSummarizationAgent`
  - **Task**: Summarizes longer scenes into shorter clips while preserving the core message or visual.
  - **Techniques**:
    - **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Summarization**: Reduces voiceover content without losing meaning.
    - **Action Condensation**: Fast-forwards or compresses action shots to fit within the cutdown version.

---

#### **3.2. Multi-Version Optimization**:
- **Agent Name**: `MultiVersionOptimizationAgent`
  - **Task**: Optimizes the creation of multiple cutdown versions for different platforms or purposes (e.g., creating 15, 30, and 45-second versions).
  - **Algorithm**: Uses a greedy algorithm to ensure that the most important scenes are included in the shortest version, and additional scenes are added as the target duration increases.

---

#### **3.3. Adaptive Feedback**:
- **Agent Name**: `AdaptiveFeedbackAgent`
  - **Task**: After generating each cutdown version, it uses feedback from platform performance (e.g., engagement rates) to iteratively improve future cutdowns.
  - **Feedback Sources**:
    - User engagement metrics (e.g., click-through rate, view time).
    - User comments or feedback.

### 4. **A: Ad Storyboard Design Agent (Follow-up/Advanced/Further Discussion Questions)**

#### **Objective**:
Advanced iterations of the Ad Storyboard Design Agent will involve more sophisticated scene refinement and platform-specific optimization.

---

#### **4.1. Scene Refinement**:
- **Agent Name**: `SceneRefinementAgent`
  - **Task**: Refines each scene by considering platform-specific details (e.g., TikTok prefers shorter, high-energy scenes while Instagram allows for more narrative depth).
  - **Tools**: GPT-4's ReACT and Few-Shot Learning to create subtle variations in scene content depending on platform feedback.

---

#### **4.2. Adaptive Scene Length Adjustment**:
- **Agent Name**: `AdaptiveSceneLengthAgent`
  - **Task**: Adjusts the length of each scene dynamically, based on feedback from the validation stage or user engagement metrics

### 5. **B: Asset & Template Fitting Process**

#### **Objective**:
The **Asset & Template Fitting Process** automates the adaptation of creative assets (e.g., images, videos, graphics) into predefined templates for digital advertising. This process ensures that assets are resized, formatted, and aligned with platform-specific requirements while retaining brand consistency and visual appeal.

---

#### **5.1. Asset Input Collection**:
- **Input Types**: The agent accepts various asset types such as:
  - **Image Files**: JPEG, PNG, SVG, etc.
  - **Video Files**: MP4, MOV, etc.
  - **Graphics & Logos**: Vector graphics or high-resolution PNG/SVG files.
- **Metadata**: Additional metadata provided with the assets, such as resolution, aspect ratio, and color profiles.

---

#### **5.2. Template Fitting**:
- **Agent Name**: `TemplateFittingAgent`
  - **Task**: Fits assets into platform-specific templates (e.g., for Facebook ads, Instagram Stories, or TikTok vertical ads). The agent ensures that the assets are resized, cropped, or reformatted to fit perfectly into the template without losing key visual elements.
  - **Template Types**:
    1. **Static Image Ads**: Adjusts images to fit predefined static ad sizes (e.g., 1080x1080 for Instagram posts).
    2. **Video Templates**: Resizes and adjusts video assets for different formats (e.g., square, vertical, or landscape videos).
    3. **Responsive Templates**: Fits assets into templates that adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions.

---

#### **5.3. Dynamic Resizing and Cropping**:
- **Agent Name**: `ResizeAndCropAgent`
  - **Task**: Dynamically resizes and crops images or videos to fit template sizes while ensuring that the key elements of the asset (e.g., a product or logo) remain visible and centrally aligned.
  - **Tools**: Uses machine learning-based image analysis to detect and preserve key elements in the asset during the resizing/cropping process.
  - **Example**:
    - For a product-focused image, the agent ensures that the product remains centered and fully visible after resizing for a smaller ad format.

---

    - **Aspect Ratio Compliance**: Ensures that the asset fits the aspect ratio guidelines (e.g., 9:16 for vertical TikTok ads or 1:1 for Instagram posts).
    - **File Size Optimization**: Compresses and optimizes assets to meet the file size limitations of platforms without losing visual quality.
    - **Content Guidelines**: Ensures that the content adheres to platform policies (e.g., no inappropriate content or misleading graphics).
