## Video Cutdown Generation

1. **Semantic Cutdown Requests**:
   - Users should be able to request cutdowns based on semantic content, such as "10s of city walking scenes."
   - The system must interpret and match user requests with relevant video segments.

2. **N x M Matching**:
   - Implement a matching system to select the best video clips for each storyboard scene.
   - Given N scenes, select the best M clips from a larger set to match the storyboards optimally.

## Ad Storyboard Design

1. **User Input Collection**:
   - Collect detailed inputs, including ad theme, platform, and duration.
   - Validate inputs to ensure completeness and adherence to platform guidelines.

2. **Ad Concept Generation**:
   - Generate high-level ad concepts using AI-driven techniques.
   - Allow for iterative refinement based on user feedback.

3. **Scene Generation and Validation**:
   - Break down ad concepts into detailed scenes.
   - Validate scenes against predefined criteria and platform standards.

## Asset & Template Fitting

1. **Asset Input Collection**:
   - Support various asset types, including images, videos, and graphics.
   - Collect metadata such as resolution, aspect ratio, and color profiles.

2. **Template Fitting and Validation**:
   - Resize and format assets to fit predefined templates.
   - Validate fitted assets against platform specifications.

These requirements aim to streamline the ad creation process, ensuring high-quality outputs that align with user-defined themes and platform guidelines.
