1. Clarify Ambiguities and Address Missing Details
Before proceeding with implementation, it's crucial to ensure that all requirements are clearly understood. Here are areas that may need further clarification:

a. User Input Handling
Partial Inputs in Step 2: Specify how the chatbot should prompt for missing information if the user provides partial data. For example:

If the user only provides the ad duration, should the chatbot ask for the ad channel next, then the ad theme?
How should the chatbot handle invalid inputs (e.g., a non-numeric value for ad duration)?
b. Brand Description Retrieval
Database Lookup Process:

Define how the brand description is retrieved. Is it based on the user's account, or do they need to specify a brand name?
What happens if the brand description is not found? Should the chatbot prompt the user to input it manually?
c. LLM Prompt Design
System Prompts for LLM:

Provide exact wording or templates for the system prompts used in LLM calls for generating the ad concept and storyboard.
Include guidelines on maintaining the brand's tone and style.
d. User Feedback Handling
Negative Feedback in Steps 4 and 6:

Define how the chatbot should interpret and act upon vague feedback like "I don't like it."
Determine how many times the user can request revisions.
e. Edge Cases and Error Handling
User Backtracking:

Clarify how to handle users who want to change previous inputs (e.g., ad duration or theme).
Define how the chatbot maintains conversation context.
f. Asset and Template Fitting
Integration with Asset Selection:

Specify how the storyboard scenes map to assets and templates in Task B.
Clarify if the asset selection process is automated or requires additional user input.
2. Improve the Document for Clarity and Completeness
Enhance the document to make it more actionable:

a. Provide Detailed Flowcharts or Diagrams
Chatbot Interaction Flow:

Create flowcharts illustrating the conversation paths, including user inputs, chatbot responses, and LLM interactions.
Highlight decision points and possible user responses.
b. Include Pseudocode or Code Snippets
Key Functionalities:

Offer pseudocode for critical components like input validation, LLM prompt construction, and state management.
This aids developers in understanding the logic without getting bogged down by syntax.
c. Define Data Models
Conversation State:

Outline how user inputs and chatbot responses are stored and accessed.
Include data structures for storing ad concepts and storyboards.
d. Elaborate on LLM Interaction
Prompt Engineering:

Provide example prompts and expected outputs.
Explain how to adjust prompts based on user feedback.
e. Specify Technology Stack Recommendations
Tools and Libraries:

Suggest programming languages, frameworks, or libraries suitable for building the chatbot (e.g., Python with Flask, Node.js, or chatbot platforms like Rasa).
Recommend APIs for LLM access (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4 API).
3. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down the implementation process into manageable steps:

Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment
Choose a Programming Language and Framework:

Recommendation: Use Python with a web framework like Flask or Django for the backend.
Install Necessary Libraries:

For chatbot functionality: flask, flask-socketio (for real-time communication).
For LLM interaction: OpenAI's openai library.
For data storage: sqlalchemy for database interactions.
Configure the Database:

Set up a simple database (e.g., SQLite) to store brand descriptions and conversation states.
Step 2: Implement the Chatbot Interface
Create the Welcome Message:

On user connection, send: "What would you like to do today?"
Handle User Responses:

Implement a function to parse and interpret user messages.
Step 3: Detect User Intent
Recognize "Make me an ad":

Use simple keyword detection or a natural language understanding (NLU) model to detect the intent.
Step 4: Collect Basic Ad Information
Prompt for Missing Information:

If the user doesn't provide all required inputs, sequentially ask for:

Ad Duration: "Please specify the ad duration in seconds (0 for static ads up to 60 seconds)."
Ad Channel: "Which ad channel would you like to use (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)?"
Ad Theme: "Please provide a short description (~50 words) of what the ad should be about."
Input Validation:

Ensure ad duration is a number within the specified range.
Validate ad channel against a list of supported platforms.
Check that the ad theme is within the word limit.
Step 5: Retrieve or Collect Brand Description
Database Lookup:

Query the database for the brand description using the user's account information.
Handle Missing Descriptions:

If not found, prompt the user: "We couldn't find your brand description. Please provide a short paragraph (~200 words) describing your brand's value proposition and style."
Step 6: Generate Ad Concept
Construct the LLM Prompt:

plaintext
Copy code
You are an expert ad creative agent tasked with writing high-level ad story concepts. You are given information about the clientâ€™s brand description and ad theme.

Brand Description:
[Brand Description]

Ad Theme:
[Ad Theme]

Please generate a brief ad concept (~100 words) elaborating on the provided theme, aligning with the brand's value proposition and style.
Call the LLM API:

Use the constructed prompt to generate the ad concept.
Display the Ad Concept:

Present the generated concept to the user for approval.
Step 7: Handle User Feedback on Ad Concept
Positive Feedback:

If the user approves ("Looks good", "I like it"), proceed to the next step.
Negative Feedback:

If the user requests a rewrite:

With Specific Feedback: Incorporate their suggestions into the new prompt.
Without Specific Feedback: Optionally, adjust the temperature or creativity settings of the LLM and regenerate.
Loop Until Approval:

Allow a reasonable number of revisions (e.g., up to 3) to prevent infinite loops.
Step 8: Generate the Storyboard
Determine Number of Scenes:

Use the ad duration to set the number of scenes.
Construct the LLM Prompt for Storyboard:

plaintext
Copy code
Based on the following ad concept, create a scene-wise storyboard with [Number of Scenes] scenes. Each scene should flow into the next, forming a coherent narrative with a beginning, middle, and end.

Ad Concept:
[Ad Concept]

Please provide a title and a brief description for each scene.
Call the LLM API:

Generate the storyboard.
Display the Storyboard:

Present it to the user for approval.
Step 9: Handle User Feedback on Storyboard
Positive Feedback:

Proceed to asset and template fitting.
Requests for Alterations:

Identify specific scenes the user wants to change.

Construct a New Prompt:

plaintext
Copy code
Please revise Scene [Number] of the storyboard as per the following feedback:

User Feedback:
[User Feedback]

Updated Scene:
Loop Until Approval or Limits Reached:

Allow a limited number of revisions per scene.
Step 10: Final Confirmation and Proceeding
Final Confirmation:

Ask: "Are you satisfied with the storyboard and ready to proceed to asset selection and template fitting?"
Proceed Based on User Response:

If "Yes", move to the next phase.

If "No", allow the user to specify what they'd like to change or if they'd like to start over.

Step 11: Maintain Conversation State
Session Management:

Use session IDs or tokens to keep track of the user's progress.
Context Storage:

Store user inputs, generated concepts, and storyboards in the database linked to their session.
Step 12: Implement Error Handling and Edge Cases
Unexpected Inputs:

Provide generic prompts: "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you please rephrase?"
LLM Errors:

Handle API timeouts or failures gracefully by informing the user and retrying if appropriate.
User Backtracking:

Allow users to return to previous steps:

"Sure, we can go back. What would you like to change?"
Step 13: Testing
Unit Tests:

Write tests for input validation functions, LLM prompt construction, and response parsing.
Integration Tests:

Simulate user interactions covering the "happy path" and edge cases.
User Acceptance Testing:

Have real users test the chatbot and provide feedback.
Step 14: Documentation
Code Comments:

Document functions and classes for maintainability.
User Guide:

Create a guide explaining how to use the chatbot and its capabilities.
API Documentation:

Document any internal APIs or services used.
Additional Considerations
For Task B: Asset & Template Fitting Process
Define Asset Selection Criteria:

Map storyboard scenes to asset requirements (e.g., image or video placeholders).
Automate Asset Matching:

Use semantic analysis to match assets to scene descriptions.
Template Integration:

Define how assets are inserted into templates, including any transformations or adjustments needed.
For Task C: Video Cutdown Generation
Clip Representation:

Implement classes for Video and Clip, including metadata.
Selection Algorithm:

Develop an algorithm to select clips that best fit the desired duration and semantic requirements.
User Semantics:

Allow users to specify themes or keywords for clip selection.
Final Tips
Iterative Development:

Build the chatbot incrementally, testing each component thoroughly before adding complexity.
User Experience Focus:

Ensure that the chatbot's responses are friendly, helpful, and guide the user smoothly through the process.
Scalability and Maintainability:

Keep the code modular to facilitate future enhancements, such as integrating Tasks B and C.
